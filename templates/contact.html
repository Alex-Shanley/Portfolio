        I've always had a deep love for music both the classics and the new. Growing up with a father in a band, I have vivid memories of him taking me to concerts across Ireland, and it was there that I truly fell in love with music in all its forms. As I got older, I knew I wanted to share that same passion with others. That's how Headline was born — a place where people can discover new jams and classic hits, all in one spot, just as I experienced it.
        <br /><br />
        Headline was my way of giving back to the world what music gave to me. It’s a platform where everyone can explore the sounds that have shaped my life whether it’s uncovering fresh tracks or revisiting timeless classics.
