Portfolio

🧠 Concept
The concept behind this portfolio site is to break away from my usual minimalist design approach and explore a bold, visually striking aesthetic. Traditionally, my designs lean toward subtle colors and clean simplicity, but with this project, I aim to make a statement—something memorable and dynamic.

The visual identity will center around a high-contrast color palette, pairing black with a vibrant neon tone to create energy and visual impact. Interactive elements will play a key role in the user experience, including a filterable JavaScript-powered gallery to showcase my work and a custom cursor that changes style based on hover interactions, adding a layer of personality and responsiveness.

The blog section will mirror this interactive philosophy, featuring hover-based prompts like “Read Article” to guide user engagement in a fluid, intuitive way.

From a development standpoint, the site will be built using Flask, leveraging its templating system to ensure consistency, maintainability, and scalability. This modular approach will enable the reuse of core layout components across pages, streamlining the design process and supporting long-term growth of the site.
